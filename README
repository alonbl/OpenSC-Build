OpenSC Project Cross Compile Build

About

	This environment provides an easy way to build
	OpenSC Project components using a cross compiler.

	The OpenSC Project does not provide CSP for Windows,
	any CSP that can use PKCS#11 interface can be used
	with the components.

Versions

	The tarballs are taken from "SOURCEROOT" directory, the
	version is not forced. If tarball is missing it is
	downloaded from its site using a specific version.

Cross compile

	$ CHOST=i686-pc-mingw32 CBUILD=i686-pc-linux-gnu ./build

MSYS
	Download and install wget msys port.

	$ WGET=/c/msys/1.0/bin/wget ./build

	The WGET is a workaround for msys wget port issue with argv[0].
